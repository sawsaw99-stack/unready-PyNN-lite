# Hello!
This README is just here to say:  
This program is lightweight for one reason:  
**I coded it on a calculator!**  
See the [wiki](github.com/sawsaw99-stack/PyNN/wiki) for more...

# Note:  
If you haven't already noticed, this repo is kind of messy 😆, but due to many factors, I am unable to clean it up at the moment. So, if you want to use this code,  
you'll have to fix everything yourself. 😕
Not that anybody is going to stumble upon this any time soon...

# Also
This repo is NOT where you should get the code. Please ask me and I will get you a legitimate copy.
